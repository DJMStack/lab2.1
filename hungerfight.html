            Our school and schools around the world have recently joined forces to fight against world hunger. The 
            office for the Fight Against World Hunger team is located next to the bookstore. You can drop off food and money 
            donations there. We also have donation drop-off locations at participating grocery stores. See the list of stores as well as additional information on the 
            bulletin board outside our team.
